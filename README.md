# Churn and Revenue Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn and revenue patterns using the `internet_service_churn.csv` dataset. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate insights that help understand the factors affecting churn and revenue trends.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about customers, their internet service usage, contract details, and whether they have churned. Key features include:
- **Customer ID**
- **Subscription Type** (Monthly, Yearly, etc.)
- **Internet Service Type** (Fiber, DSL, None)
- **Billing Amount**
- **Payment Method**
- **Churn Status** (Yes/No)

## Project Goals
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Handling missing values
   - Visualizing key trends
   
2. **Revenue Analysis**:
   - Identifying revenue distribution across customer segments
   - Analyzing revenue trends based on churn status
   
3. **Churn Prediction Insights**:
   - Identifying key factors influencing churn
   - Understanding customer retention patterns

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Scikit-Learn** (for potential churn modeling)

## Installation
To run the analysis, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Apurv-panbude24/Churn-and-revenue-analysis.git
cd Churn-and-revenue-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the provided notebooks step by step to perform data analysis and visualization.

## Results & Insights
- **High churn rate among customers with monthly contracts**
- **Fiber-optic users show higher revenue but also higher churn**
- **Auto-payment methods correlate with lower churn rates**

## Future Enhancements
- Build a predictive model for churn forecasting
- Perform customer segmentation for better retention strategies
